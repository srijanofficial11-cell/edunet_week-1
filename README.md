### 🧠 Week-1: EV Chatbot & Vehicle Data Analysis

#### 📋 Project Overview

The rapid growth of the electric vehicle (EV) industry makes analyzing performance, specifications, and market trends essential for manufacturers, analysts, and consumers. However, raw data is often inconsistent, unstructured, or incomplete, hindering effective analysis and forecasting.

This repository details a project with two primary components:

1.  *Chatbot Development:* A conversational chatbot prototype for EV-related interactions.
2.  *EV Data Analysis:* The preprocessing, cleaning, and exploration of an electric vehicle dataset to derive actionable insights.

The ultimate goal is to combine conversational AI with data analytics to effectively understand and communicate trends within the EV industry.
